    "# Part 1.4 - REs and Finite State Automata\n",
    "\n",
    "In Natural Language Processing (`NLP`), Finite Automata play a crucial role in recognizing and processing patterns within text. They are used to model the sequence of states and transitions that a system undergoes in response to a string of inputs, making them particularly effective for tasks like lexical analysis, tokenization, and syntax parsing. The theory of Finite Automata is deeply intertwined with Regular Expressions (`Regex`), as every regular expression can be converted into an equivalent finite automaton, and vice versa. This relationship is significant because it provides a formal and efficient way to implement `Regex` patterns using finite state machines. By understanding Finite Automata, Parham can gain insight into how `Regex` operates at a fundamental level, allowing him to better grasp how patterns are matched and how text is processed in various NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives:** \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, Parham will have learned the theory of Finite Automata and how to apply it in code. He will leverage the well-known Python library, `automata-lib`, to gain hands-on experience with the `Automaton` class. Finally, Parham will use the available functions of the library to convert finite automata patterns into `Regex` patterns.\n",

    "## 2. Introduction to the Theory of Finite Automata\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite Automata are a foundational concept in computer science, particularly within formal language theory and natural language processing (NLP). A Finite Automaton is a simple computational model designed to recognize patterns within input data, making it crucial for tasks such as lexical analysis, pattern matching, and syntax parsing. Essentially, a Finite Automaton is an abstract machine that processes a sequence of input symbols, transitioning through a series of states according to a predefined set of rules. The machine comprises the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A finite set of states**: These represent the various configurations in which the machine can exist.\n",
    "- **An input alphabet**: A finite set of symbols that the machine can read and process.\n",
    "- **A transition function**: This defines how the machine moves from one state to another based on the current input symbol.\n",
    "- **A start state**: The initial state where the machine begins processing the input.\n",
    "- **Accepting (final) states**: Specific states that determine if the input is accepted (i.e., if the pattern is recognized) when the machine finishes processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary types of Finite Automata:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**: In a DFA, each state has exactly one transition for each possible input symbol. This ensures that for any given state and input, the next state is uniquely determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)**: In an NFA, a state may have multiple transitions for the same input symbol or may transition to a new state without consuming any input (ε-transitions). This non-determinism allows the NFA to explore multiple computational paths simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: A Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a system designed to detect a specific sequence of heads (H) and tails (T) from a series of coin tosses. The system is particularly interested in identifying a sequence where tails occur in the last two flips:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sequence = (H , T)* TT`\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to construct a state diagram that recognizes this sequence. The state diagram can be illustrated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"../imgs/finite_auto_diagram.png\" alt=\"Finite Automata Diagram\" width=\"50%\" height=\"10%\" style=\"display: block; margin: 20px auto;\"/></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, each symbol is defined as follows:\n",
    "- **a** : \"Ends with heads\"\n",
    "- **b** : \"Ends with 1 tail\"\n",
    "- **c** : \"Ends with 2 tails\"\n",
    "- **e** : \"Error\"\n",
    "- **H** : Head\n",
    "- **T** : Tail\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simplified procedure that outlines how the system processes a sequence of heads (`H`) and tails (`T`) to detect when two consecutive tails (`TT`) occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start at State `a`**:  \n",
    "  - The initial state where the system begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If Input Symbol is `T`**:  \n",
    "  - From State `a`:  \n",
    "    - Transition to State `b`.\n",
    "  - From State `b`:  \n",
    "    - Transition to State `c` (final state).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If Input Symbol is `H`**:  \n",
    "  - From Any State (`a`, `b`, or `c`):  \n",
    "    - Transition back to State `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If Input Symbol is not `H` or `T`**:  \n",
    "  - From Any State (`a`, `b`, or `c`):  \n",
    "    - Transition to State `e` (Error state).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If in State `c` (Final State)**:  \n",
    "  - The sequence \"TT\" has been detected, meaning the system has recognized the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition table for such a system can be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Current State / Inputs | H  | T  | Other |\n",
    "|------------------------|----|----|-------|\n",
    "| a                      | a  | b  | e     |\n",
    "| b                      | a  | c  | e     |\n",
    "| c                      | a  | c  | e     |\n",
    "\n",

    "**Exercise:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a basic CPU, instructions are represented by 2-bit opcodes. The control unit, modeled as a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), reads these opcodes to determine which operation to execute, such as load, store, add, or halt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DFA for a 2-Bit Instruction Decoder:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **States**:\n",
    "   - The DFA has four states, each corresponding to one of the four possible instructions:\n",
    "     - **`Load` (0)**: Load data from memory.\n",
    "     - **`Store` (1)**: Store data to memory.\n",
    "     - **`Add` (2)**: Add two values.\n",
    "     - **`Halt` (3)**: Halt the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Symbols**:\n",
    "   - The input symbols are 2-bit binary opcodes: `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initial and Accepting States**:\n",
    "   - The initial state is the starting point where no operation has been selected.\n",
    "   - Each of the states (`Load`, `Store`, `Add`, `Halt`) can be considered an accepting state because they represent valid operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Input Sequence**:\n",
    "   - The DFA processes sequences of inputs as shown below:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   input_sequences = [\n",
    "       '3',        # Should go to 'Halt' and be accepted\n",
    "       '0', '1', '3',  # Should eventually go to 'Halt'\n",
    "       '2', '3',        # Should go to 'Halt' from 'Add'\n",
    "       '0', '1', '2', '3'  # Should eventually go to 'Halt'\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "- The DFA begins in an initial state, waiting for an opcode input.\n",
    "- Upon receiving a 2-bit opcode, it transitions to the corresponding operation state.\n",
    "- For example:\n",
    "  - If the input is `0`, it transitions to the `Load` state and generates control signals to perform a load operation.\n",
    "  - If the input is `3`, it transitions to the `Halt` state, signaling the end of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transition Table for the Instruction Decoder:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Current State | Opcode (Input) | Next State | Operation       |\n",
    "|---------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| `Start`       | `0`            | `Load`     | Load from memory|\n",
    "| `Start`       | `1`            | `Store`    | Store to memory |\n",
    "| `Start`       | `2`            | `Add`      | Add values      |\n",
    "| `Start`       | `3`            | `Halt`     | Stop execution  |\n"

    "- The automaton begins in the initial state `q0`.\n",

    "  - If no further input is given, the automaton can non-deterministically move to state `q2`.\n",
    "  - From `q2`, the NFA can transition back to `q0` upon reading a \"b\". This design prevents consecutive \"b\"s by forcing the automaton to restart the pattern matching process after each \"b\".\n",

    "\n",
    "In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a regular language (also called a rational language) is a type of formal language that can be precisely defined by a regular expression (`Regex`). While modern `Regex` engines often include additional features to recognize non-regular languages, the traditional `Regex` is limited to defining regular languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular language can also be characterized as one recognized by a finite automaton. This connection between regular expressions and finite automata is established by Kleene's theorem, which states that every regular expression corresponds to a finite automaton and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "While finite automata (specifically NFAs) do not inherently include methods for checking whether one NFA is a subset of another, this can be managed by converting regular expressions to NFAs. Through these conversions, it's possible to determine if the language recognized by one NFA is a subset of the language recognized by another.\n"
