    "\n",
    "In Natural Language Processing (`NLP`), tagging is a crucial process for annotating text with meaningful labels that aid in linguistic and semantic analysis. Among these, **Part-of-Speech (`POS`) tagging** plays a foundational role in identifying the grammatical roles of words in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb. This understanding is critical for tasks like syntactic parsing, named entity recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech systems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`POS` tagging methods have evolved from rule-based systems to sophisticated algorithms like **Hidden Markov Models (`HMMs`)** and **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)**, which leverage statistical properties for better contextual analysis. More recently, **neural network-based models** have introduced significant advancements, enabling state-of-the-art performance by leveraging word embeddings and deep learning architectures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives:**  \n",
    "In this notebook, Parham provides an overview of Part-of-Speech tagging, its significance in `NLP`, and the algorithms behind it, including Hidden Markov Models (`HMMs`) and neural networks. Through practical exercises, Parham will train a neural network for `POS` tagging and use `NLTK` to implement the Stanford `POS` Tagger.  \n",

    "In Natural Language Processing (NLP), **tagging** involves assigning meaningful labels to elements of text, such as words, phrases, or sentences. These labels capture linguistic or semantic information that is essential for various NLP applications. For example:  \n",
    "- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Assigns grammatical roles (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifies proper nouns like names, locations, or organizations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL):** Describes the roles words play in the semantic structure of a sentence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each tagging approach serves a unique purpose, contributing to tasks like text parsing, translation, summarization, and information extraction. Techniques for tagging range from traditional rule-based systems to modern neural network-based methods:  \n",
    "- **Rule-Based Tagging:** Relies on linguistic rules and patterns. It works well for predictable structures but struggles with ambiguity and language variability.  \n",
    "- **Statistical Tagging:** Algorithms like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) use probabilistic methods to predict tags based on contextual patterns in labeled data.  \n",
    "- **Neural Network-Based Tagging:** Leverages word embeddings and deep learning architectures like BiLSTMs and Transformers to achieve state-of-the-art performance by capturing complex patterns in language.  \n",

    "### 2.1. Part-of-Speech Tagging: A Closer Look  \n",
    "\n",
    "Among these approaches, **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging** is a foundational task in NLP. It identifies the grammatical role of each word in a sentence, helping to structure raw text for downstream tasks. Consider the sentence:  \n",
    "\n",
    "_\"Computer Science department of Sapienza University of Rome is intellectually lively and reputed for its research outcome.\"_  \n",
    "\n",
    "POS tagging identifies:  \n",

    "- department    → Noun (NN)  \n",

    "- is            → Verb (VBZ)  \n",
    "- intellectually → Adverb (RB)  \n",

    "\n",
    "By providing information about grammatical structure, this tagging helps machines understand not just individual words, but also the connections between them within a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Two classes of words: **Open** vs. **Closed**:\n",
    "- Closed class words\n",
    "    - Relatively fixed membership\n",
    "    - Usually function words: short, frequent words with grammatical function\n",
    "    - determiners: a, an, the\n",
    "    - pronouns: she, he, I\n",
    "    - prepositions: on, under, over, near, by, …\n",
    "- Open class words\n",
    "    - Usually content words: Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs\n",
    "    - Plus interjections: oh, ouch, uh-huh, yes, hello\n",
    "    - New nouns and verbs like iPhone or to fax\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Why Part-of-Speech Tagging?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s why POS tagging is so valuable:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supports Other NLP Tasks**: POS tagging provides crucial insights for tasks like syntactic parsing, sentiment analysis, and text-to-speech systems.  \n",
    "- **Parsing**: Knowing POS tags can improve syntactic parsing accuracy, which is vital for machine translation and language understanding.  \n",
    "- **Machine Translation (MT)**: POS tags help reordering structures, such as adjectives and nouns, when translating between languages like Spanish and English.  \n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Distinguishing adjectives or verbs can reveal sentiment or emotional tone in text.  \n",
    "- **Text-to-Speech**: Pronunciation ambiguity, as seen with words like *lead* or *object*, can be resolved using POS tags.  \n",
    "- **Linguistic Analysis**: POS tagging aids in studying linguistic evolution, identifying meaning shifts, and creating new words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, POS tagging acts as a bridge, enabling both practical NLP tasks and linguistic research to benefit from accurate syntactic understanding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4. How Difficult is POS Tagging in English?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although English `POS` tagging has achieved high accuracy, it is not without challenges. Ambiguity is a major issue:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- About **15% of word types** in English are ambiguous (e.g., *back* can be a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb).  \n",
    "- However, **85% of word types are unambiguous** (e.g., *Sapienza* is always a proper noun, and *intellectually* is always an adverb).  \n",
    "- The ambiguous 15% are highly frequent in text, meaning **~60% of word tokens** in actual usage are ambiguous.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are examples of how the word *back* varies based on context:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjective (ADJ)**: _Earnings growth took a **back** seat._  \n",
    "- **Noun (NOUN)**: _A small building in the **back**._  \n",
    "- **Verb (VERB)**: _A clear majority of senators **back** the bill._  \n",
    "- **Particle (PART)**: _Enable the country to buy **back** debt._  \n",
    "- **Adverb (ADV)**: _I was twenty-one **back** then._  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5. POS Tagging Performance  \n",
    "\n",
    "How accurate is POS tagging? Modern methods have achieved impressive results:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tagging Accuracy**: About **97%**, which hasn't changed much in the last decade. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), and neural network-based approaches like BERT perform similarly.  \n",
    "- **Baseline Accuracy**: Even a \"stupid\" baseline, such as tagging every word with its most frequent tag or unknown words as nouns, achieves **92%** accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The high accuracy is partly because many words are unambiguous. However, improving the remaining 3% can be difficult due to rare and ambiguous cases.  "

    "  - Uses lexicons (dictionaries) where words are tagged with their possible parts of speech.  \n",
    "  - Applies hand-crafted rules to disambiguate between possible tags based on word context.  \n",

    "\n",

    "## 4. Using NLTK to Handle Stanford POS Tagger  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Stanford `POS` Tagger is a robust and accurate tool for Part-of-Speech tagging, widely used in computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing. It is written in Java and provides pre-trained models for English and several other languages. Despite being Java-based, it can be seamlessly integrated into Python workflows, particularly with the help of libraries like NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use the Stanford POS Tagger?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pre-trained Models: Comes with high-quality, pre-trained models for multiple languages.\n",
    "- Integration: Can be easily integrated with Java and Python workflows.\n",
    "- Customizability: While NLTK’s integration offers limited model options, standalone usage provides flexibility in choosing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Stanford PoS Tagger in NLTK\n",
    "`NLTK` integrates a version of the Stanford PoS tagger as a module that can be run without a separate local installation of the tagger. This is the simplest way of running the Stanford PoS Tagger from Python. It has, however, a disadvantage in that users have no choice between the models used for tagging. This is, however, a good way of getting started using the tagger. The script below gives an example of a script using the Stanford PoS Tagger module of NLTK to tag an example sentence:"
