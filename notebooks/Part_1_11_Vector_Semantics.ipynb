    "# Part_1_11_Vector Semantics (Sparse)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Natural Language Processing (`NLP`), vector semantics provides a powerful framework for representing words and documents in a numerical form, enabling efficient computation and semantic analysis. Sparse vector representations, such as **Bag of Words (`BoW`)**, **TF-IDF**, and **Pointwise Mutual Information (`PPMI`)**, have been foundational in the evolution of `NLP`. These approaches rely on statistical co-occurrence patterns and word frequency to capture linguistic meaning, forming the basis for more sophisticated methods like dense embeddings and contextualized models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse representations are particularly useful in understanding the core principles of vector semantics and building intuition about the role of word-document relationships in tasks like text classification, clustering, and retrieval systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives:**\n",
    "In this notebook, Parham provides an overview of sparse vector semantics, including the key methods used to represent text data and their significance in `NLP`. Through practical exercises, Parham will demonstrate the implementation of **Bag of Words (`BoW`)** for document representation, **TF-IDF** to highlight significant terms within documents, and **PPMI** to extract meaningful statistical relationships from co-occurrence matrices.\n",

    "## 2. Introduction to Vector Semantics\n",
    "Vector semantics is a methodology in `NLP` that uses numerical representations to encode the meaning of words, phrases, or entire documents. These numerical representations are essential for enabling machines to process and analyze human language. By transforming textual data into vectors, computational models can perform mathematical operations to assess similarity, context, and relationships between words or documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Vector Semantics?\n",
    "- **Quantitative Representation**: Text data, being inherently qualitative, is challenging for computers to process directly. Vector semantics bridges this gap by converting text into a mathematical form.\n",
    "- **Efficient Computation**: Mathematical representations allow for quick calculations of similarity, clustering, and classification tasks.\n",
    "- **Foundation for Machine Learning Models**: Many machine learning models rely on vectorized representations of data as input.\n"

    "## 3. Bag of Words (`BoW`) Representation \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bag of Words** (`BoW`) is a simple and widely-used representation of text data in Natural Language Processing. It represents text as a collection of words, ignoring grammar, word order, and context, while preserving the frequency of words.BoW boadly used in tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis. This is important because machine learning algorithms can’t process textual data. The process of converting the text to numbers is known as feature extraction or feature encoding."

    "While the Bag of Words model provides a simple representation of text data, it does not account for the importance of words within a document or across multiple documents. **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** improves upon this by assigning a weight to each word that reflects its relevance to a specific document in the corpus.\n",
